# evince is not written with application confinement in mind and is designed to
# operate within a trusted desktop session where anything running within the
# user's session is trusted. That said, evince will often process untrusted
# input (PDFs, images, etc). Ideally evince would be written in such a way that
# image processing is separate from the main process and that processing
# happens in a restrictive sandbox, but unfortunately that is not currently the
# case. Because evince will process untrusted input, this profile aims to
# provide some hardening, but considering evince's design and other factors such
# as X, gsettings, accessibility, translations, DBus session and system
# services, etc, complete confinement is not possible.
